Hello Everyone,

I am excited to announce my recent SQL project called "Pizza Sales Analysis". This project uses SQL to analyze the dataset of pizza sales. 

The following tables were used in this project:

- order_details
- orders
- pizza_types
- pizzas

The project aims to answer the following questions:

1. Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
2. Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
3. Identify the highest-priced pizza.
4. Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
5. List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

Intermediate level questions:

6. Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
7. Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
8. Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
9. Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
10. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

Advanced level questions:

11. Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
12. Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.

Thank you!
